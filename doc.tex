\section{Vector spaces}

\paragraph{Multivariate polynomials}
The set of real-valued multivariate polynomials of degree at most $D$ in
$n$-dimensional space, $\PolDn$, is a vector space with addition and scalar
multiplication defined in the usual way.
The degree of a monomial is the sum of its exponents,
and the degree of a polynomial is the greatest degree of its monomials
with a non-zero coefficient.
For polynomials of degree at most $D$, we define the set of monomials as
\[\MonDn = \{X_1^{e_1} X_2^{e_2} \dots X_n^{e_n} \mid \sum_{i=1}^n e_i \leq D\}.\]
This set of monomials forms a basis for the vector space $\PolDn$,
so the dimension of $\PolDn$ is equal to the number of basis vectors in $\MonDn$ which is
\[\begin{pmatrix} D + n \\ D \end{pmatrix}.\]

In our examples where $n = 2$, we define our polynomials using the formals $X$
and $Y$ instead of $X_1$ and $X_2$.

\paragraph{Functions on a finite domain}
Similarly, the set of functions from a finite set
$S = \{s_1, \dots, s_{\Ssz}\}$ into $\reals$,
denoted $\StoR$, is a vector space of dimension $\Ssz$;
the basis we consider is the standard basis $\StandardBasis$
consisting of the $\Ssz$ functions $e_i : S \to \reals$
each mapping $s_i$ to $1$ and the others to $0$.
The coordinate vector of a function $f : S \to \reals$
is simply $[f]_{\StandardBasis} = ( f(s_1), \dots, f(s_{\Ssz}) )^\T$.

Another view of $\StoR$ is that we have relabeled
the coordinates of the $\Ssz$-dimensional space $\reals^{\Ssz}$
to the points in $S$,
but viewing $\StoR$ as a function space will be useful later on.

\chapter{Polynomials from root sets}

\section{The case in $\reals$ (when $n = 1$)}

Given a set of $D$ roots in $\reals$,
say $\{-1, 1, 4, 6\}$,
it should be easy to see that a degree-$D$ polynomial with these roots is
\[f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 6) = x^4 - 10 x^3 + 23 x^2 + 10 x - 24.\]
In one dimension, this construction is trivial,
but it is not apparent how to generalize this to multivariate polynomials.
What happens if we apply a bit of linear algebra?

\section{Generalizing to higher dimension}

The \emph{restriction map}
\[\restS : \PolDn \to \StoR\]
restricts a polynomial $p : \reals^n \to \reals$ to just the finite subset
$S \subset \reals^n$. In other words, if $p \in \PolDn$
and $f = \restS(p)$, then in order to evaluate $f$ at a point $s \in S$,
we simply let $f(s) = p(s)$. If a polynomial $p$ is zero on all of $S$,
then $\restS(p) = \V 0_{\StoR}$, the zero element (or zero function) of $\StoR$.
For an example of $\restS$, see \rfig{rest}.

\begin{figure}
\input{rest.pgf}
\caption{

  $\restS(p)$ and another function in $\StoR$.
}
\label{fig:rest}
\end{figure}

The map $\restS$ is a linear map from the vector space $\PolDn$ % of dimension $\BigO(D^n)$
to the vector space $\StoR$. % of dimension $\Ssz$.
When the dimension of the domain of a linear map is strictly greater than the
dimension of its range, it follows that the linear map has a non-trivial kernel.
Put simply, when $D$ is large enough, we can find a non-zero polynomial of
degree $D$ that becomes the zero function when viewed as a function in $\StoR$!
In fact, it turns out that for any point set $S \subset \reals^n$,
we can find a non-zero polynomial of degree $\BigO(n\Ssz^{1/n})$
that is zero on all the points in $S$,
since the dimension of $\PolDn$ is on the order of $\BigO(D^n)$.

Using the set of monomials $\MonDn$ as our basis for $\PolDn$,
and the basis $\StandardBasis$ for $\StoR$ previously introduced,
we can write the matrix representation of the linear map $\restS$ as follows:

\[
  M_{\MonDn, \StandardBasis}(\restS)
  = \left( [m_i]_\StandardBasis \mid m_i \in \MonDn \right).
\]

Using this matrix representation, we can solve a linear system of equations
in order to find a non-zero polynomium that is zero on all points in a finite point set.

\section{Example: Circle in $\reals^2$}

For example, let us aim for points on a circle with diameter 5.
We set $S = \{(0, 1), (2, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (2, 5), (0, 4)\} \subset \reals^2$
and we wish to set up a linear system of equations for a polynomial in $\Pol22$.
In our system $A\V x = \V 0$,
each row of $A$ will correspond to a root in $S$
with corresponding function value $0$ on the right hand side,
and each column of $A$ will correspond to a monomial in $\Mon22$:
\begin{gather*}
  A =
  M_{\Mon22, \StandardBasis}(\restS)
  =
  (m_i(S) \mid m_i \in \Mon22)
      \\
    \newcommand{\row}[1]{%
    1(#1) & X(#1) & Y(#1) & X^2(#1) & XY(#1) & Y^2(#1)}%
= \begin{pmatrix}
  \row{0, 1} \\
  \row{2, 0} \\
  \row{4, 1} \\
  \row{4, 4} \\
  \row{2, 5} \\
  \row{0, 4}
\end{pmatrix}
\\
= \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  1 & 2 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & 4 & 1 & 16 & 4 & 1 \\
  1 & 4 & 4 & 16 & 16 & 16 \\
  1 & 2 & 5 & 4 & 10 & 25 \\
  1 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 16
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{gather*}
Notice how in each column of $A$ we applied a monomial of $\Pol22$ to the given roots $S$.

If we solve the system of equations $A\V x = \V 0$, we find the family of solutions
\[
  \V x = (4a, -4a, -5a, a, 0, a)^\T, a \in \reals
\]
corresponding to the family of polynomials
\[
  4a - 4ax - 5ay + ax^2 + ay^2 = a((x - 2)^2 + (y - \frac 52)^2 - \frac{25}{4}), a \in \reals
\]
which are exactly the polynomials with zero set equal to the circle
of diameter 5 containing the points $S$.
